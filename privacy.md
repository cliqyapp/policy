By using our Service you understand and agree that we are providing a platform for you to post content, including photos, comments and other materials ("User Content"), to the Service and to share User Content publicly. This means that other Users may search for, see, use, or share any of your User Content that you make publicly available through the Service, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use (which can be found at [Terms of Service]([http://www.google.com/policy/tos).
Our Policy applies to all visitors, users, and others who access the Service ("Users").

This privacy statement ("Privacy Policy") covers all applications owned and operated by Cliqy and all associated services, collectively referred to as "the Service".

We use information you share with us for our internal business purposes. We do not sell your information. This notice tells you what information we collect, how we use it, and steps we take to protect and secure it.

## 1. Information we collect

Like most apps, we collect Non-Personal Data such as the date and time of each visitor request.

We collect this to understand how our visitors and members use our service, and use it to make decisions about how to change and adapt the service.

From time to time, we may utilize Non-Personal Data in aggregate form (for instance, by publishing trends in site usage) to explain our reasoning in making decisions. We will not release individual information, only aggregate information.

### Information you provide us directly:

* Your username, name, and e-mail address when you register for an Cliqy account
* Profile information that you provide for your user profile (e.g., first and last name, picture, phone number). This information allows us to help you or others be "found" on Cliqy
* User Content (e.g., photos, comments, and other materials) that you post to the Service
* Communications between you and Cliqy. For example, we may send you Service-related emails (e.g., account verification, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices). Note that you may not opt out of Service-related e-mails.

### Finding your friends on Cliqy:

* If you choose, you can use our search features to locate other people with Cliqy accounts either through your contacts listor through a search of names and usernames on Cliqy
* If you choose to find your friends through your device's contacts list, then Cliqy will access your contacts list to determine whether or not someone associated with your contact is using Cliqy
* If you choose to find your friends through a search of names or usernames on Cliqy then simply type a name to search and we will perform a search on our Service
* Note about "Create a Clique" feature: If you choose to invite someone to the Service through our "Create a Clique" feature, you may select a person directly from the contacts list on your device and send a text or email from your personal account.

### Log file information:

### Device identifiers:

* When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access our Service, we may access, collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or remotely store one or more "device identifiers." Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device's operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by Cliqy
* A device identifier may allow us to push notifications and alerts to your device which can always be disabled. Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.

### Metadata:
* Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with User Content. For example, Metadata can describe how, when and by whom a piece of User Content was collected and how that content is formatted
* Users can add or may have Metadata added to their User Content including a hashtag (e.g., to mark keywords when you post a photo, comments or other data. This makes your User Content more searchable by others and more interactive.
